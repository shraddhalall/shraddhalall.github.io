			<h2>Teaching</h2>
		</header>

<p>I am passionate about pedagogy and strive to create engaging, inclusive classrooms. As a graduate student in the Organismic &amp; Evolutionary Biology department, I taught the following courses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Evolutionary Biology:</strong><br>
    This course was all things evolution, from its history to the mechnaisms behind evolution and major evolutionary patterns and process. I led weekly small-group sections covering core concepts, solving numerical problems &amp; moderating paper discussions. I also mentored students on their synthesis term papers, and delivered a lecture on experimental evolution.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Population Genetics:</strong><br>
    Focussing on the mathematics of studying evolving populations, this course was fully theoretical. I ran weekly problem-solving sessions and graded problem sets.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Fishy Aspects of the Human Body:</strong><br>
    An interdiscplinary course, this emphasized science communication using Shubin’s <em>Finding Your Inner Fish</em>. Every week, we discussed one chapter of this book focussing on the scientific research underlying it as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the communication of this research. Additionally, I led weekly labs wherein we used museum specimens to understand how vertebrates evolved.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Understanding Darwinism:</strong><br>
    This course combined the history of evolutionary biology with key concepts in evolution. I led discussion sections on research papers and Darwin’s <em>Origin</em> and supervised final papers or creative projects exploring a facet of evolution.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Foundations of Biological Diversity:</strong><br>
    I taught this course during the pandemic! I led virtual discussions, supervised at-home experiments and helped students write a final pratice grant proposal on a topic of their choice.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="content">Pedagogical Development: </h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bok Center Teaching Certificate</strong> — Harvard Derek Bok Center for Teaching &amp; Learning.</li> <br>
  <li><strong>Workshop:</strong> “How to Teach Writing Assignments—And Design Your Own” <br>
  Designing effective writing assignments and fair grading approaches across STEM and non-STEM. <br><br></li>
  <li><strong>Workshop:</strong> “Teaching with Generative AI” <br>
  Exploring the practical uses and caveats of generative AI for teaching and course logistics (including custom GPTs).</li>
</ul>
